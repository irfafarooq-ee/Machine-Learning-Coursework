# Machine Learning Coursework

This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning assignments and lab notebooks developed using Google Colab**. The notebooks demonstrate practical implementations of machine learning concepts using Python and widely used ML libraries.

---

## 📘 Overview

Machine Learning enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming. This repository focuses on hands-on experimentation using **Machine Learning in Google Colab**, allowing easy execution, visualization, and experimentation without local setup.

The notebooks cover the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
